### Api

Use the hook and set your swipe(d) handlers.

```jsx
const handlers = useSwipeable({
  onSwiped: (eventData) => console.log("User Swiped!", eventData),
  ...config,
});
return <div {...handlers}> You can swipe here </div>;
```

Spread `handlers` onto the element you wish to track swipes on.

## Props / Config Options

### Event handler props

```js
{
  onSwiped,       // After any swipe   (SwipeEventData) => void
  onSwipedLeft,   // After LEFT swipe  (SwipeEventData) => void
  onSwipedRight,  // After RIGHT swipe (SwipeEventData) => void
  onSwipedUp,     // After UP swipe    (SwipeEventData) => void
  onSwipedDown,   // After DOWN swipe  (SwipeEventData) => void
  onSwipeStart,   // Start of swipe    (SwipeEventData) => void *see details*
  onSwiping,      // During swiping    (SwipeEventData) => void
  onTap,          // After a tap       ({ event }) => void
}
```

#### Details
- `onSwipeStart` - called only once per swipe at the start and before the first `onSwiping` callback
  - The `first` property of the `SwipeEventData` will be `true`

### Configuration props and default values

```js
{
  delta: 10,                            // min distance(px) before a swipe starts
  preventScrollOnSwipe: false,          // prevents scroll during swipe in most cases (*See Details*)
  trackTouch: true,                     // track touch input
  trackMouse: false,                    // track mouse input
  rotationAngle: 0,                     // set a rotation angle
}
```

## Swipe Event Data

All Event Handlers are called with the below event data, `SwipeEventData`.

```js
{
  event,          // source event
  initial,        // initial swipe [x,y]
  first,          // true for first event
  deltaX,         // x offset (current.x - initial.x)
  deltaY,         // y offset (current.y - initial.y)
  absX,           // absolute deltaX
  absY,           // absolute deltaY
  velocity,       // âˆš(absX^2 + absY^2) / time - "absolute velocity" (speed)
  vxvy,           // [ deltaX/time, deltaY/time] - velocity per axis
  dir,            // direction of swipe (Left|Right|Up|Down)
}
```

**None of the props/config options are required.**

### Hook details

- Hook use requires **react >= 16.8.3**
- The props contained in `handlers` are currently `ref` and `onMouseDown`
  - Please spread `handlers` as the props contained in it could change as react improves event listening capabilities

### `preventScrollOnSwipe` details

This prop prevents the browser's [touchmove](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchmove) event default action (mostly scrolling) by calling `e.preventDefault()` internally.

Use this to **stop scrolling** in the browser while a user swipes.

`e.preventDefault()` is only called when:
  - `preventScrollOnSwipe: true`
  - `trackTouch: true`
  - the users current swipe has an associated `onSwiping` or `onSwiped` handler/prop

Example scenario:
> If a user is swiping right with props `{ onSwipedRight: userSwipedRight, preventScrollOnSwipe: true }` then `e.preventDefault()` will be called, but if the user was swiping left then `e.preventDefault()` would **not** be called.

Please experiment with the [example app](http://formidablelabs.github.io/react-swipeable/) to test `preventScrollOnSwipe`.

#### passive listener
With v6 we've added the passive event listener option, by default, to **internal uses** of `addEventListener`. We set the `passive` option to `false` only when `preventScrollOnSwipe` is `true` and only `onTouchMove`. Other listeners will retain `passive: true`.

**When `preventDefaultTouchmoveEvent` is:**
  - `true`  => `el.addEventListener(event, cb, { passive: false })`
  - `false` => `el.addEventListener(event, cb, { passive: true })`

Here is more information on react's long running passive [event issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6436).

We previously had issues with chrome lighthouse performance deducting points for not having passive option set so it is now on by default except in the case mentioned above.

If, however, you really **need** _all_ of the listeners to be passive (for performance reasons or otherwise), you can use the `touch-action` css property instead, [see below for an example](#how-to-use-touch-action-to-prevent-scrolling).

### Browser Support

The release of v6 `react-swipeable` we only support browsers that support options object for `addEventListener`, [Browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Browser_compatibility). Which mainly means `react-swipeable` does not support ie11 by default, you need to polyfill options. For example using [event-listener-with-options](https://github.com/Macil/event-listener-with-options).

### Version 6 Updates and migration

If upgrading from v5 or later please refer to the release notes and the [v6 migration doc](./migration.md)

v6 now only exports a hook, `useSwipeable`.

If would like something similar to the old `<Swipeable>` component you can recreate it from the hook. There are examples in the [migration doc](./migration.md#swipeable-component-examples).

## FAQs

### How can I add a swipe listener to the `document`?
Example by [@merrywhether #180](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable/issues/180#issuecomment-649677983)
```js
const { ref } = useSwipeable({
  ...
}) as { ref: RefCallback<Document> };

useEffect(() => {
  ref(document);
});
```

### How to share `ref` from `useSwipeable`?

**Example ref passthrough, [more details #189](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable/issues/189#issuecomment-656302682):**
```js
const MyComponent = () => {
  const handlers = useSwipeable({ onSwiped: () => console.log('swiped') })

  // setup ref for your usage
  const myRef = React.useRef();

  const refPassthrough = (el) => {
    // call useSwipeable ref prop with el
    handlers.ref(el);

    // set myRef el so you can access it yourself
    myRef.current = el;
  }

  return (<div {...handlers} ref={refPassthrough} />
}
```

### How to use `touch-action` to prevent scrolling?

Sometimes you don't want the `body` of your page to scroll along with the user manipulating or swiping an item. Or you might want all of the internal event listeners to be passive and performant.

You can prevent scrolling via [preventScrollOnSwipe](#preventscrollonswipe-details), which calls `event.preventDefault()` during `onTouchMove`. **But** there may be a simpler, more effective solution, which has to do with a simple CSS property.

`touch-action` is a CSS property that sets how an element's region can be manipulated by a touchscreen user. See the [documentation for `touch-action`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action) to determine which property value to use for your particular usecase.

#### Static example
```js
const handlers = useSwipeable({
  onSwiped: (eventData) => console.log("User Swiped!", eventData),
  ...config,
});

return <div {...handlers} style={{ touchAction: 'pan-y' }}>Swipe here</div>;
```
This explanation and example borrowed from `use-gesture`'s [wonderful docs](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/docs/extras/#touch-action).

#### Dynamic example
```js
const MySwipeableComponent = props => {
  const [stopScroll, setStopScroll] = useState(false);

  const handlers = useSwipeable({
    onSwipeStart: () => setStopScroll(true),
    onSwiped: () => setStopScroll(false)
  });

  return <div {...handlers} style={{ touchAction: stopScroll ? 'none' : 'auto' }}>Swipe here</div>;
};
```

This is a somewhat contrived example as the final outcome would be similar to the static example. However, there may be cases where you want to determine when the user can scoll based on the user's swiping action along with any number of variables from state and props.
