# Simple Pattern

Below is an example implementation of a simple pattern which utilizes the hooks provided by `react-swipeable` within a TypeScript context.

## Simple Pattern Code Source

You can see this full example as pure code within the [Pattern.tsx](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable/blob/main/examples/app/SimplePattern/pattern.tsx) file within the React-Swipeable repo directly.

## Simple Pattern Code Explained

Import the hook directly from the `react-swipeable` library, along with the directions from the library, and the `SwipeEventData`. In our example, we built and imported a local set of UI components: you can utilize your own UI and styling, or use your favorite UI component library of choice.

```typescript
import React, { FunctionComponent, ReactNode } from 'react';
import { useSwipeable, UP, DOWN, SwipeEventData } from 'react-swipeable';
import {
  Wrapper,
  CarouselContainer,
  CarouselSlot,
  PatternBox,
  PREV,
  NEXT,
  D
} from '../components';
```

In our example, we utilize SVGs for our `UpArrow` and `DownArrow` to give indications of when someone is successfully activating the pattern for user feedback, but know you can use whatever UI library of your choice, or stylize your own!

```typescript
const UpArrow = ({active}: {active: boolean}) => (
  <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" style={{width: '15px'}}>
    <g transform="translate(-35.399 -582.91)">
      <path style={{fill: active ? '#EEEE00' : '#000000'}} d="m40.836 598.91v-6.75h-5.4375l4-4.625 4-4.625 4 4.625 4 4.625h-5.0938v6.75h-5.4688z" />
    </g>
  </svg>
);

const DownArrow = ({active}: {active: boolean}) => (
  <svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" style={{width: '15px'}}>
    <g transform="translate(-35.399 -598.91)">
      <path style={{fill: active ? '#EEEE00' : '#000000'}} d="m40.836 598.91v6.75h-5.4375l4 4.625 4 4.625 4-4.625 4-4.625h-5.0938v-6.75h-5.4688z" />
    </g>
  </svg>
);
```

Next, we set up our types for the `Directions`, `CarouselState`, and `CarouselAction`.

```typescript
type Direction = typeof PREV | typeof NEXT;

interface CarouselState {
  pos: number;
  sliding: boolean;
  dir: Direction;
}

type CarouselAction =
  | { type: Direction, numItems: number }
  | { type: 'stopSliding' };
```

Below, we create a function called `getOrder`, which drives the position of each item in the carousel, and what order of position each will be displayed in the context of the carousel. Then, we set a `pattern` as an array of the pattern we want the user to follow to unlock the slide action. Finally here, we then set `getInitialState`, setting the position of the initial items, the `sliding`, as false, and the direction. 

```typescript

const getOrder = (index: number, pos: number, numItems: number) => {
  return index - pos < 0 ? numItems - Math.abs(index - pos) : index - pos;
};

const pattern = [UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN];

const getInitialState = (numItems: number): CarouselState => ({ pos: numItems - 1, sliding: false, dir: NEXT });

```

At the bottom of the file, we set up a reducer for controlling the action of the Carousel utilizing a switch to set the `CarouselState` logic.

```typescript
function reducer(state: CarouselState, action: CarouselAction): CarouselState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case PREV:
      return {
        ...state,
        dir: PREV,
        sliding: true,
        pos: state.pos === 0 ? action.numItems - 1 : state.pos - 1
      };
    case NEXT:
      return {
        ...state,
        dir: NEXT,
        sliding: true,
        pos: state.pos === action.numItems - 1 ? 0 : state.pos + 1
      };
    case 'stopSliding':
      return { ...state, sliding: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Then, building upon the reducer logic, the `<Carousel>` is constructed. We hold the number of items within `numItems`, and utilize the reducer within the `React.useReducer` hook.

By creating the `slide`, as a `const`, we can utilize that to call within `handleSwiped` as an action that is called upon the user successfully execution of the pattern.

It may help to briefly look at the `handlers` for a moment, and how we utilize `useSwipeable`. Within this, with each `onSwiped`, we call `handleSwiped`. So for each swipe the user takes within the text box above the carousel, we execute `handleSwiped` and pass along the `eventData`. If the `eventData.dir` matches the pattern for this indexed (`pIdx`) item, and the direction indicated, then we `setPIdx` to a greater number. 

What does this do? Two things: it helps us know when the user successfully got to the end of the pattern, and activate the `slide` action, and it also controls the arrows activating the color within the `<PatternBox>` to give feedback to the user that they were successful in activating the steps of the pattern! 

Two other important items to note: we utilized `onTouchStartOrOnMouseDown` to pass through `event.preventDefault()` as a callback, and used `touchEventOptions: {passive: false}` in case certain browsers ignored the `preventDefault()` callback bubbling up. 

From there, the rest of the UI of the component is built. The `<PatternBox>` holds where the user swipes in order to interact with the Carousel itself, along with the arrows that give the feedback to the user that the pattern was successful. The `<CarouselContainer>` holds the Carousel display and items. Our Simple Pattern is complete!

```typescript
const Carousel: FunctionComponent<{children: ReactNode}> = (props) => {
  const numItems = React.Children.count(props.children);
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, getInitialState(numItems));

  const slide = (dir: Direction) => {
    dispatch({ type: dir, numItems });
    setTimeout(() => {
      dispatch({ type: 'stopSliding' });
    }, 50);
  };

  const [pIdx, setPIdx] = React.useState(0);

  const handleSwiped = (eventData: SwipeEventData) => {
    if (eventData.dir === pattern[pIdx]) {
      // user successfully got to the end of the pattern!
      if (pIdx + 1 === pattern.length) {
        setPIdx(pattern.length);
        slide(NEXT);
        setTimeout(() => {
          setPIdx(0);
        }, 50);
      } else {
        // user is cont. with the pattern
        setPIdx((i) => (i += 1));
      }
    } else {
      // user got the next pattern step wrong, reset pattern
      setPIdx(0);
    }
  };

  const handlers = useSwipeable({
    onSwiped: handleSwiped,
    onTouchStartOrOnMouseDown: (({ event }) => event.preventDefault()),
    touchEventOptions: { passive: false },
    preventScrollOnSwipe: true,
    trackMouse: true
  });

  return (
    <>
      <PatternBox {...handlers}>
        Swipe the pattern below, within this box, to make the carousel go to the next
        slide
        {`\n`}
        <p style={{textAlign: 'center', paddingTop: '15px'}}>
          Swipe:
          <D><UpArrow active={pIdx > 0} /></D>
          <D><DownArrow active={pIdx > 1} /></D>
          <D><UpArrow active={pIdx > 2} /></D>
          <D><DownArrow active={pIdx > 3} /></D>
        </p>
      </PatternBox>
      <div style={{paddingBottom: '15px'}}>
        <Wrapper>
          <CarouselContainer dir={state.dir} sliding={state.sliding}>
            {React.Children.map(props.children, (child, index) => (
              <CarouselSlot
                key={index}
                order={getOrder(index, state.pos, numItems)}
              >
                {child}
              </CarouselSlot>
            ))}
          </CarouselContainer>
        </Wrapper>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```
