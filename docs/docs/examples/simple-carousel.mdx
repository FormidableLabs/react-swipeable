# Simple Carousel

Below is an example implementation of a simple carousel which utilizes the hooks provided by `react-swipeable` within a TypeScript context.


## Simple Carousel Code Source

You can see this full example as pure code within the [Carousel.tsx](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable/blob/main/examples/app/SimpleCarousel/Carousel.tsx) file within the React-Swipeable repo directly.

Note: The action of swiping must have a duration of `500ms` or lower in order to trigger the swipe action.

## Simple Carousel Code Explained

Import the hook directly from the `react-swipeable` library. In our example, we built and imported a local set of UI components: you can utilize your own UI and styling, or use your favorite UI component library of choice.

```typescript
import { useSwipeable } from 'react-swipeable';
import {
  Wrapper,
  CarouselContainer,
  CarouselSlot,
  SlideButtonContainer,
  SlideButton,
  PREV,
  NEXT
} from '../components';
```

Below, we set up types and an interface for some of the work we'll be building. Next, we write a function called `getOrder`, which will drive the position of each item in the carousel, and what order of position each will be displayed in context of the carousel. Finally, we have a simple `getInitialState` position that sets the `CarouselState` of the carousel we'll be building.

```typescript
type Direction = typeof PREV | typeof NEXT;

interface CarouselState {
  pos: number;
  sliding: boolean;
  dir: Direction;
}

type CarouselAction =
  | { type: Direction, numItems: number }
  | { type: 'stopSliding' };


const getOrder = (index: number, pos: number, numItems: number) => {
  return index - pos < 0 ? numItems - Math.abs(index - pos) : index - pos;
};

const getInitialState = (numItems: number): CarouselState => ({ pos: numItems - 1, sliding: false, dir: NEXT });
```

Next, we build a reducer for controlling the action of the Carousel, using a switch to set `CarouselState` logic.

```typescript
function reducer(state: CarouselState, action: CarouselAction): CarouselState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case PREV:
      return {
        ...state,
        dir: PREV,
        sliding: true,
        pos: state.pos === 0 ? action.numItems - 1 : state.pos - 1
      };
    case NEXT:
      return {
        ...state,
        dir: NEXT,
        sliding: true,
        pos: state.pos === action.numItems - 1 ? 0 : state.pos + 1
      };
    case 'stopSliding':
      return { ...state, sliding: false };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Then, building upon the reducer logic, the `<Carousel>` is constructed. We hold the number of items within a count of `numItems`. We utilize the reducer within the `React.useReducer` hook.

By creating `slide`, as a `const`, we can utilize that later in the component, calling it within `useSwipeable`: called upon `slide(NEXT)` and `slide(PREV)`, invoking the `dispatch` and the `timeout` we built within `slide`. Within the use of `useSwipeable`, we set `swipeDuration` to `500ms`. We set `preventScrollOnSwipe` to `true`, and `trackMouse` to `true`.

At the end, we return the component itself, built with the components we've created, with `handlers` passed into the wrapping `<div>` around the surrounding container. The `<CarouselContainer>` holds the directional and sliding state, and within that container the items we want to display are mapped as `React.Children`, utilizing `getOrder`. 

When we put it all together, our `<Carousel>` is complete!

```typescript
const Carousel: FunctionComponent<{children: ReactNode}> = (props) => {
  const numItems = React.Children.count(props.children);
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, getInitialState(numItems));

  const slide = (dir: Direction) => {
    dispatch({ type: dir, numItems });
    setTimeout(() => {
      dispatch({ type: 'stopSliding' });
    }, 50);
  };

  const handlers = useSwipeable({
    onSwipedLeft: () => slide(NEXT),
    onSwipedRight: () => slide(PREV),
    swipeDuration: 500,
    preventScrollOnSwipe: true,
    trackMouse: true
  });

  return (
    <div {...handlers}>
      <Wrapper>
        <CarouselContainer dir={state.dir} sliding={state.sliding}>
          {React.Children.map(props.children, (child, index) => (
            <CarouselSlot
              order={getOrder(index, state.pos, numItems)}
            >
              {child}
            </CarouselSlot>
          ))}
        </CarouselContainer>
      </Wrapper>
      <SlideButtonContainer>
        <SlideButton onClick={() => slide(PREV)} float="left">
          Prev
        </SlideButton>
        <SlideButton onClick={() => slide(NEXT)} float="right">
          Next
        </SlideButton>
      </SlideButtonContainer>
    </div>
  );
};
```
