# Introduction

Using react swipeable is easy! Follow the simple steps below:

1. Import `useSwipeable` hook from `react-swipeable`
2. Set the swipe handlers you care about
3. Spread the handlers onto an html tag to bind to the events

```jsx
import { useSwipeable } from 'react-swipeable';

const handlers = useSwipeable({
    onSwiped: (eventData) => console.log("User Swiped!", eventData),
  ...config,
});
return <div {...handlers}> You can swipe here </div>;
```

Spread `handlers` onto the element you wish to track swipes on.

import React from "react";

import SwipeDemo from '@site/src/components/examples/SwipeDemo'

<SwipeDemo />
