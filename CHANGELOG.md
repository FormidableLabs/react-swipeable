# v6.0.0
**New Features:**
- include passive event listener option, by default, to internal uses of `addEventListener`
  - solves issue with chrome and lighthouse - [#167](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable/issues/167)
  - set `passive` to `false` only when `preventDefaultTouchmoveEvent` is `true`.
  - more details in [readme#passive-listener-issue](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable#passive-listener)
- add new `onTap` event handler prop which executes its callback after a tap
  - Thank you [@upatel32](https://github.com/upatel32)!
- add new `vxvy` event data property
  - `[ deltaX/time, deltaY/time]` - velocity per axis
  - Thank you [@upatel32](https://github.com/upatel32)!

**Breaking Changes:**
- **remove** `<Swipeable>` component
  - see below for an example of how to make your own
  - [Swipeable component examples](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable/blob/main/migration.md#swipeable-component-examples)
- **event data update** correctly calculate `deltaX` and `deltaY`
  - from `initial - current` **to** `current - initial`
  - fixes issue [#157](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable/issues/157)
  - Thank you [@upatel32](https://github.com/upatel32)!
- **drop support for ie11**
  - using `addEventListener` options object needs to be polyfilled, [browser support](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable#browser-support)
- **requires** react >= 16.8.3, additionally supports new react v17

**Bug fixes:**
- Swipes can now start at edges (x or y === 0)
  - fixes [#182](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-swipeable/issues/182)
  - Thank you [@upatel32](https://github.com/upatel32)!

**Infrastructure:**
- **typescript** Converted entire code base, tests, and examples to typescript
  - **changed type** `EventData` -> `SwipeEventData` - The event data provided for all swipe event callbacks

  - **removed types** associated with `<Swipeable>` component
  - **new type** `TapCallback` - callback for the new `onTap` prop handler
  - **new type** `SwipeDirections` - `"Left" | "Right" | "Up" | "Down"`
- Converted tests to `@testing-library/react`, [react testing library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- Build bundles with `microbundle`. [microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle)
  - export new "modern" build - via package.json `esmodule` property
    - [microbundle modern mode](https://github.com/developit/microbundle#-modern-mode-)

  * will allow to set a rotation angle, e.g. for a four-player game on a tablet, where each player has a 90Â° turned view.
  * Thank you [@Narquadah](https://github.com/Narquadah) and [@LarsKumbier](https://github.com/LarsKumbier)!

# 4.2.2
* fixed bug that happened when if either `onSwiping` or `onSwiped` were set we were not calling `e.preventDefault()` appropriately

# 4.2.0
* Add support for calling `preventDefault` on Chrome 56+ via passive event support checking and manual event listener setup. [#88](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/pull/88)
  * Thank you [@kl0tl](https://github.com/kl0tl) and [@KrashStudio](https://github.com/KrashStudio)!

# 4.0.1
* fixed bug where delta was causing a swipe to not be tracked correctly, #74 , thanks @mctep

# 4.0.0

* **Major Change** `preventDefaultTouchmoveEvent` defaults to `false` now [#69](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/issue/69)
  * This change is in part due to a [Chrome56+ change](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable#chrome-56-and-later-warning-with-preventdefault)
* **Major Change** drop support for React 12 & 13, `peerDependencies` updated [#64](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/pull/64)
  * `prop-types` added to `dependencies` [#64](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/pull/64)
* **Major Change** `trackMouse` now 'tracks' the swipe outside of the swipeable component, [#67](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/pull/67).
  * Thanks for example [@TanaseHagi](https://github.com/TanaseHagi)
* react 16 added to `peerDependencies`

# 3.9.0

* add `onTap` functionality. Thanks [@anicke](https://github.com/anicke) . [#61](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/pull/61) [#39](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/issues/39)
* added persisting synthetic event in example via `e.persist()`. This should help people see more details in the console when debugging in the [example](http://stack.formidable.com/react-swipeable/.

# 3.8.0

* Allow `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, and `onMouseMove` props to fire appropriately again. [#55](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/pull/55), thanks [@lochstar](https://github.com/lochstar)
* Stop using this.state to track swipes, thanks [@grantila](https://github.com/grantila) for pointing out this change and submitting PR, [#58](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/pull/58). Should provide minor performance gains since `Swipeable` will no longer be calling `this.setState` internally.

# 3.7.0

* add ability to track mouse events as touch events. Thanks [@jakepusateri](https://github.com/jakepusateri) and [@Marcel-G](https://github.com/Marcel-G). [#51](https://github.com/formidablelabs/react-swipeable/issues/51)
